       <h1> What do you want to know about me?</h1>
        There are quite a few things to know when getting to know me. 
        I am a semi-outgoing person that loves trying new things at least once.
        I have yet to physically travel outside of the contenintal USA but I can get there with a good book.
        I am a certified rescue scuba diver, lifeguard trainer and future computer programmer.
        I'm married (Aaron) with 3 kids (Devin, Saniya and Lela) a dog named beauty and two goldfish(Orange and M'Baku).
